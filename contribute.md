# MAKE YOUR OWN MAP

If you would like to make a map for this game, that would be great!
**Follow the these steps to get started**:

<br>

### First things first: Draw a design

Every level in this game all starts with a design.

You can make your own design by drawing on a piece of paper, using programs like photoshop or inkscape, lego bricks, special design softwares,
or any kind of reasonable medium that is capable of being uploaded to the internet digitally. 

In every level, the road size is `15` units wide; And each brick of obstacle is `2` units wide, and `1` unit thick.
A `0.25` unit of space on both left and right sides of road the must be kept with no obstacles.
Therefore, every unit forward on the road can hold up to a maximum of `7` obstacles.

You may use any symbol or shape to represent an obstacle, for instance, an X, or a rectangle. As long as it is reasonable or understandable, it's ok.

You might not know that it is completely ok to briefly draw, since nobody is crazy enough to draw a design 2 meters in length,
It is completely ok to just simply show how the obstacles is placed throughout the level.

Most levels is split into sections of obstacles, thus, **it is recommended that you plan your level's sections before you actually start designing**.
These levels usually contain 2 to 4 sections, anything more than 6 sections is too long.

Also note that if your design should not contain more than 40 obstacles, anything more than that is considered too long, so keep that in mind.

You don't need to include the player starting point and the finish line in your design, even if you do, it will be ignored.
At the start of each level, a starter block placed in the middle must be present,
though you don't have to include it in your design, it is worth considering the the placement afterwards.

Once you have finished your design, take a picture or export it in .jpg .jpeg .png or .pdf format, and then follow the next step.

It is ok if you export if in other formats and then proceed to the next step, it may work, but it's not guaranteed.
Also make sure that your product is clear and intelligible.

### Second things second: Submission and approval

Once you have your design product ready, submit your product via teams to `2027RHUANG`.

You will also have to provide a name, codename, or pseudoname that you wish to appear in the credits.
Make sure it's appropriate, or it won't be eligible for publication. It should not cause disconfort to anyone, nor can it contain swear words.

You will also ALSO have to provide how hard do you expect your level to be, and add any extra information if you need to.

Then, your design will be under approval. If your design is eligible for publication, it's then just a matter of time until your design is up in the game.

The map will be changed a little bit if it need to, so don't expect everything to be exactly what you expected.
